# Claude API Error Handling Adjustments

This document details the changes made to improve error handling for Claude API integration in the Bible Cross Reference application.

## Error Types Addressed

1. **Claude API Overloaded (529)**
   - **Issue**: Claude's API servers return status code 529 with `{"type":"error","error":{"type":"overloaded_error","message":"Overloaded"}}` during high demand
   - **Impact**: Users were receiving technical error messages that weren't user-friendly

2. **Authentication Errors (401)**
   - **Issue**: Issues with content-type headers for static JSON files
   - **Impact**: Resources like manifest.json were failing to load properly

3. **General Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: Generic error messages weren't informative enough for users
   - **Impact**: Poor user experience when errors occurred

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Error Handling (server.js and index.js)

Added specific detection for Claude API overloaded errors:

```javascript
else if (error.message && error.message.includes('529') && error.message.includes('overloaded')) {
  res.status(503).json({ 
    error: 'Claude AI is currently experiencing high demand. Please try again in a few minutes.',
    details: 'The Claude API servers are temporarily overloaded.'
  });
}
```

This converts the technical 529 error to a more user-friendly 503 Service Unavailable with a clear message.

### 2. Client-Side Error Handling (BibleApp.js)

Enhanced the error handling in the frontend to provide user-friendly messages:

```javascript
if (error.message && error.message.includes("Claude AI is currently experiencing high demand")) {
  setOutputText("‚ö†Ô∏è Claude AI is currently experiencing high demand. Please try again in a few minutes.");
} else if (error.message && error.message.includes("Invalid password")) {
  setOutputText("üîë Invalid password. Please check your password and try again.");
} else {
  setOutputText(`Error: ${error.message || "Failed to get response from Claude API. Please try again later."}`);
}
```

This provides:
- Emoji-prefixed messages for better readability
- Context-specific error messages
- Actionable guidance for users

### 3. Static File Content Type Headers (index.js)

Updated the Express static file serving to explicitly set content types:

```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build'), {
  setHeaders: (res, path) => {
    if (path.endsWith('.json')) {
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    }
  }
}));
```

This ensures that JSON files are served with the correct content type, preventing authentication errors.

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Users now see clear, actionable error messages
   - Technical details are hidden from users but still logged for debugging

2. **Better Error Recovery**
   - The system can gracefully handle temporary Claude API outages
   - Users are informed when to retry rather than being stuck

3. **Comprehensive Error Categorization**
   - Different error types are now handled specifically
   - Future error types can easily be added to the pattern

## Testing the Error Handling

To verify these changes work correctly:

1. **For Claude Overloaded Errors**:
   - These occur naturally during periods of high demand
   - The system will now display: "‚ö†Ô∏è Claude AI is currently experiencing high demand. Please try again in a few minutes."

2. **For Authentication Errors**:
   - The password validation will show: "üîë Invalid password. Please check your password and try again."

3. **For Other API Errors**:
   - The system will still log detailed information to the console
   - Users will see a generic but friendly error message

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements to error handling:

1. Implement automatic retry logic for temporary errors like 529
2. Add a visual indicator (spinner/progress bar) during API calls
3. Develop a more comprehensive error categorization system
4. Implement client-side caching to reduce API calls during high demand periods
